[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

Exercise 4.2 The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.
1. Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF.
2. Is the distribution uniform?

random_nums = np.random.random(size=1000)

random_pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(random_nums, label='random numbers')
thinkplot.Pmfs([random_pmf])

random_cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(random_nums, label='random numbers')
thinkplot.Cdf(random_cdf)
thinkplot.Show(xlabel='random numbers', ylabel='CDF')

Comments: Since results from  numpy.random.random are, by definition, from the “continuous uniform” distribution, the CDF graph will look like an even distribution as well.
